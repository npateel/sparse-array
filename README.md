# sparse-array
Implements a sparse array using bitvectors

## Installation
After installing [sdsl](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite) to your home directory, run `make`. 
This creates a binary `rank` in `bin`. rank contains a main and nothing else, so make sure to change `main.cpp` 
if you want to do something with the code.
